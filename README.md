# Debt-snowball
This pagelet will calculate and display the length of time to pay off a list of debts, and the total amount paid.

## Methods

**Debt Avalanche**
Paying higest interest first. Mathematically this saves you the most money. When each loan is paid off the old payment gets moved to the next loan.

**Debt Snowball**
Paying lowest balance first. This method gives the payer the most motivation. When each loan is paid off the old payment gets moved to the next loan.

**Minimum payment**
This is the worst way to pay, and makes you fight against compound interest.
